## Research

In my research, I study the properties and behaviour of random mathematical structures and algorithms. I use these insights to develop tools and models that are supported by theoretical guarantees and allow us to better work with and understand large-scale, complex data.

My main interests are broadly in probability and mathematical data science, including high-dimensional and discrete probability, random matrices, randomised algorithms, and numerical linear algebra. I am also interested in the applications of these areas to statistics, computer science, and machine learning.
