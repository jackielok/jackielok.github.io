## Research

My research lies at the interface of mathematics and data science. I study the properties and behaviour of random mathematical structures and algorithms, and use these insights to develop tools and models that allow us to better work with and understand large-scale, complex data.

More specifically, my research interests include high-dimensional probability, random matrices, randomised algorithms, and numerical linear algebra. I am also interested in the intersections of these areas with statistics, computer science, and machine learning.
