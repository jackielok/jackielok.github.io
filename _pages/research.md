## Research

My research is broadly in the mathematics of data science. I study the properties and behaviour of random mathematical structures and algorithms, and aim to use these insights to develop tools and models that allow us to better work with and understand large-scale, complex data.

My research interests mainly lie at the intersection of probability, statistics and optimisation. More
specifically, my interests include high-dimensional probability, random matrices, randomised algorithms,
numerical linear algebra, and machine learning.
